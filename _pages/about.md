Welcome to my personal homepage. My name is David Basanta and I am an Associate Member at the [Integrated Mathematical Oncology department](https://moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/quantitative-science/integrated-mathematical-oncology). I am also [affiliated](https://moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/david-basanta-gutierrez/) with the Genitourinary department also at Moffitt and the department of [Oncologic Sciences at the University of South Florida](http://cancerbiology.usf.edu/). [My group and I](https://cancerevo.org/) work trying to understand cancer ecology and evolution through mathematical models and collaborations with experimental cancer biologists.  


Cancer Ecology & Evolution
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).


Scientists Inc
------
I work with [Scientists Inc](https://scientistsinc.org/), a registered non-profit in the US with the aim of doing science communication and outreach. Scientists Inc is led by [Parmvir Bahia](https://www.parmvir.com/) and our work is pursued through a number of initiatives such as the [2Scientists](https://2scientists.org/) podcast and the [taste of science](https://tasteofscience.org/) festival (across many cities in the US and also online). Scientists Inc also helps with our own IMO workshop at Moffitt and you can check our work [here](https://imoworkshop.org/videos.html).
