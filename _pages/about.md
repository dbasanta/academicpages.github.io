Welcome to my personal homepage. My name is David Basanta Gutierrez and I am an Associate Member at the [Integrated Mathematical Oncology department](https://moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/quantitative-science/integrated-mathematical-oncology). I am also [affiliated](https://moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/david-basanta-gutierrez/) with the Genitourinary department also at Moffitt and the department of [Oncologic Sciences at the University of South Florida](http://cancerbiology.usf.edu/). [My group and I](https://cancerevo.org/) work trying to understand cancer ecology and evolution through mathematical models and collaborations with experimental cancer biologists.  


Cancer Ecology & Evolution
------
Advanced cancers are heterogeneous and evolve resistance to existing clinical treatments through a process of [somatic evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_evolution_in_cancer). This evolution is driven by intra-tumor heterogeneity and shaped by a process of selection that includes both natural selection (the cancer ecosystem) as well as treatment. Our [group](https://cancerevo.org/) has been working with the labs of cancer biologists such as [Conor Lynch](https://labpages2.moffitt.org/lynch/), with whom we have been studying treatment of tumors in the bone, and [Andriy Marusyk](https://lab.moffitt.org/marusyk/), with whom we investigate evolution and treatment in lung and breast cancer.


Scientists Inc
------
I work with [Scientists Inc](https://scientistsinc.org/), a registered non-profit in the US with the aim of doing science communication and outreach. Scientists Inc is led by [Dr. Parmvir Bahia](https://www.parmvir.com/) and our work is pursued through a number of initiatives such as the [2Scientists](https://2scientists.org/) podcast and the [taste of science](https://tasteofscience.org/) festival (across many cities in the US and also online). Scientists Inc also helps with our own IMO workshop at Moffitt and you can check our work [here](https://imoworkshop.org/videos.html).
